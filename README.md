# Backend-Project-Video-Hosting-Service

##The goal of this project is to build a server that can handle a large volume of traffic while providing a smooth user experience. To achieve this, we will be using a combination of Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer, and Spring Boot MVC as the application framework.

## Project Description
This is a server project that utilizes Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer, and Spring Boot MVC as the application framework. The goal of the project is to build a scalable and high-performance server that can handle a large volume of traffic and provide reliable service.

## Installation and Setup
To get started with the project, you will need to follow these steps:

Install Nginx on your server and configure it as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
Set up the server environment, including the operating system, required dependencies, and database.
Install the Spring Boot MVC application and configure it to work with Nginx.
Test the server to ensure that it's working as expected.
For detailed instructions on how to install and set up the project, please refer to the documentation.

## Usage
This server project is intended to be used as a backend service for a web application or mobile application. It provides APIs for data access and business logic processing. The APIs are designed to be RESTful and stateless, allowing for easy scaling and horizontal expansion.

To use the server, simply make requests to the API endpoints using a tool like curl or a REST client. The API documentation is included in the documentation for the project.
